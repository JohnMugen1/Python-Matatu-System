                                                      # Python-Matatu-System
                        -This is a program that is implemented for matatu passengers to check up for available trips or book for a trip.
                                                     
                                                    Description -- A matatu check up system: 
                         -A passenger must be from embu county else the system won't serve his/her expectations.
                         -The passenger must provide his/her details i.e name and location which must be embu for the system to serve the passenger
                         -The passenger can book a trip or can check the remaining number of trips that a matatu has to accomplish,and can maybe decide to book for one 
                         if they still exist.
                         -It is assumed that in this program,whenever a matatu makes a trip,the system gets update and son on.All the data of the day about the number
                         of trips is erased at the end of the day
                                                      Tools Used:
                         -The program is purely written in python programming language.It only covers the basics as advanced concepts such as classes are not implemented
                         in this program
                                                      Main Purpose:
                          -The program can play a very handy role for python beginners,as it focuses mainly on moduralization-a very important concept in programming
                          -The concept is expressed in a friendly-manner with comments that gives a hint of what is happening.
                                                      Conclusion:
